  <h2>Some Other Filler Stuff</h2>
  <h3>Why I'm taking this class</h3>
  <p>Honestly, I'm mainly just taking this class because I needed a
    few more credits to graduate. I just took CSE477
    which is just a harder version of this class that covers many more topics</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/nathankurt">Here's My GitHub!</a></p>
  <h3>Pro-Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Instead of paying for Dreamweaver, Use <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/student/">PHP Storm or WebStorm</a>. It's free for students
        and has a ton of stuff that makes life easier. For example, instead of having to edit your changes in an FTP each time, you can <a href="https://imgur.com/a/538JNTS">set up a remote host</a>,
        then <a href="https://imgur.com/tEU1thB">Set where your files are</a>, add the credentials in once and have it automatically upload to the server and you can view your changes with the Click of a button </p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <p>Use <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> because dealing with CSS can be Hell sometimes. and SASS/SCSS makes it so much easier. You can nest things, use variables, and more. I don't know what I'd do without it!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you don't already know, don't use Open Office. While you're a student you can get MS Office for free <a href="https://portal.office.com/">here!</a> Just sign in with your MSU email,
        And then click install office on the upper-right hand side of the screen.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
